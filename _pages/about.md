Hi! I'm a 2nd-year PhD student in Linguistics at [NYU]((https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics.html)), advised by [Liina Pylkkänen](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/liina-pylkkanen/) and a member of [NeLLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/). My research focuses on the neurolinguistic bases of language, particularly the syntax-semantics interface. Currently, I’m working on a structural priming project using Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation (RPVP), exploring how the brain responds to small sentences flashed quickly one after another.

Before NYU, I earned my BA in Languages (“Letras” - Portuguese and French) and my MA in Linguistics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://www.portal.letras.ufrj.br/)). I was advised by [Aniela França](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3217127142809144) and conducted research in [Acesin Lab](https://acesin.letras.ufrj.br/en/), investigating the neurophysiology of lexical access with EEG. My work focused on the processing of (currently) semantically opaque words.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching shows and movies, and staying active through sports like running, rollerblading, surfing, and kitesurfing. I also (try to) play the piano!

If you’re a fellow Latinx student considering a PhD in the US, feel free to reach out — I’d be happy to help! For Brazilian students, I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FJpS_HwTRI), where I share my motivations and insights on the application process.
