I'm a 2nd year PhD student at NYU, advised by Liina Pylkk√§nen. I'm interested in neurolinguistics, syntax and morphology.

Before coming to NYU, I completed my undergrad in Languages (Linguistics, Portuguese and French) and my master in Linguistics, both at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I was a member of the Acesin Lab and I researched the neurophysiology of lexical access using EEG. I was particularly interested in how we process words that are (currently) semantically opaque. An example is the word 'restaurant'. Did you know it comes from the verb 'to restore'? It's supposedly a place where we go when we need to restore our strengh. But I'm sure you don't think of that when you chose a restaurant to celebrate your birthday. My research was about how our linguistic cognition parses this type of word. Does it recognize the root to 'to restore' inside 'restaurant', or does it create a new entry in our mental lexicon?

In my free time, I like to read, to surf and to kitesurf. I also (try to) play the piano. 

If you are a fellow Latinx student and are thinking about coming to the US for a PhD, I'll be happy to help. Fell free to email me. If you're a Brazilian, I also recommend this video, in which I talk about my motivation for coming and the application process.
