Hi! I'm a 2nd year PhD student at [NYU Linguistics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics.html). I'm advised by [Liina Pylkkänen](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/liina-pylkkanen/), and a member of [NeLLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/). I'm interested in the neurolinguistics bases of language, specifically regarding the syntax-semantics interface and morphology. Right now I'm working on a structural priming project using Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation (RPVP). We're excited to check how the brain responds to small sentences fleshed quickly after one another.

Before coming to NYU, I completed my undergrad in Languages (``Letras" - Portuguese and French) and my master in Linguistics, both at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ]([https://ufrj.br/en/](https://www.portal.letras.ufrj.br/))). I was advised by [Aniela França](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3217127142809144) and was a member of [Acesin Lab](https://acesin.letras.ufrj.br/en/), where I researched the neurophysiology of lexical access using EEG. I was particularly interested in the processing of (currently) semantically opaque words. 

In my free time, I like to read, to watch shows and movies, and to do some sports: running, rollerblading, surfing, kitesurfing. I also (try to) play the piano. 

If you are a fellow Latinx student and are thinking about coming to the US for a PhD, I'll be happy to help. Fell free to email me. If you're a Brazilian, I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FJpS_HwTRI), in which I talk about my motivation for coming and the application process.
