I'm a 1st year PhD student at NYU, advised by __. I'm interested in _______.

Before coming to NYU, I completed my undergrad in Languages (Linguistics, Portuguese and French) and my master in Linguistics, both at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I was a member of the Acesin Lab and I researched the neurophysiology of lexical access using EEG. I was particularly interested in how we process words that are (currently) semantically opaque. An example is _____.

In my free time, I like to read, to surf and to kitesurf. I also (try to) play the piano. 

If you are a Latin student and are thinking about coming to the US for a PhD, I'll be happy to help. Fell free to email me. If you're a Brazilian, I also recommend this video, in which I talk about my motivation for coming and the application process.
